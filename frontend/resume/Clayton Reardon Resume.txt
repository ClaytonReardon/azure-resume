INTRO
________________


I began my career in cybersecurity through hands-on experience with the penetration testing playground, HackTheBox, initially as a hobby, subsequently as a passion. Holding CompTIA Security+, Microsoft Azure Fundamentals and Administration certifications, I've expanded my expertise through various home-lab projects and Azure Cloud implementations, all documented on my GitHub. I am excited to continue to learn and grow in this field, undertake more projects, hack more boxes, and discover more of the many niches tech has to offer. While my focus is on offensive security, I am also entirely open to the possibility that a different sector will catch my eye.[a]

EXPERIENCE
________________


Home Lab
One of my main hobbies is setting up different tech projects at home.
* FileSharing and Database Website: I set up a website hosted in Azure that utilizes Azure functions to upload files to blob storage and generate SAS URLs. Depending on the contents of the file, a series of logic checks will be checked, and a virtual network containing various subnets and virtual machines will be automatically deployed using ARM templates. The website also utilizes another Azure function to interact with an SQL database to place orders and update store inventory. A CI/CD pipeline is set up using a Github Workflow. The writeup can be found on my Github
* Networking Infrastructure: I set up Azure networking infrastructure implementing dual virtual networks, integrating services such as VMs, load balancers, Azure Bastion, and Recovery Services Vault, across multiple subnets. Utilized a Site-to-Site VPN and networking peering to allow access from my local network. Utilized Azure VMs for web hosting integrated with an SQL servier, and a backend load balancer. Implemented Azure Bastion to allow secure access to the networks, and a Recovery Services Vault for data security. The writeup can be found on my Github.
* IoT Device simulation and monitoring: I set up an Azure IoT Hub and simulated multiple devices and telemetry. Routed data to Azure Stream and Log Analytics for data monitoring. I also sent data to a Power BI workspace for powerful real-time data visualization. Implemented alerts and action groups to notify administrators when certain conditions are met. The writeup of this project can be found on my Github.[b]
* Azure Powered Resume: I’ve set up a website hosted on Azure to showcase my resume. It  uses a CosmosDB instance to monitor page views. The writeup can be found on my Github.




HackTheBox
An offensive security playground. It’s a ton of fun and a great resource.
* A link to writeups I've created describing techniques, methodology and the process behind cracking various systems can be found here.
* Requires problem solving, out of the box thinking, persistence, and "jack of all trades" knowledge, you have to learn a little bit about many technologies
* The community of individuals looking to help and give back to the infosec community is invaluable, and I try to do my part to help newer users. My forum account can be found here.
