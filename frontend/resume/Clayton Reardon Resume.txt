Hello my name is Clayton and I’m currently making the transition from the music industry into the Cybersecurity field. My focus is offensive security but I am open to learning about all the niches that infosec has to offer. Security has really captured my interest and I’m investing a lot of time and energy to learn and enhance my skill set. I am excited to join this industry and continue to learn.
